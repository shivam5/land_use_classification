Dependencies
-------------
theano
pip install theano

matplotlib
pip install matplotlib

open cv
pip install opencv-python

requests
pip install requests


For downloading the data, preprocessed data and saved models:
--------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./resolve_dependencies

Data processing
----------------
For training the network, we have first preprocessed the data (the training, validation as well as test), by extracting the different channels of the images and creating separate files.
This is done by the code/loading_data.py file.
It takes the images in Data/processed_test, Data/processed_train, Data/processed_val and then creates the files:

Data/test_data.npy, Data/train_data.npy, Data/val_data.npy -> Which is the test, train and validation data for the network.

To do this, open terminal (make sure Data/processed_test, Data/processed_train, Data/processed_val are present):
Go to code folder
$ python loading_data.py


Training models
----------------
We have trained a model which take data from the files created in Data folder, train the model, and save the model with maximum accuracy on the validation data in saved_models folder.

For training model:
Go to code folder
$ python model.py


Testing
--------

Go to code folder
$ python test.py


Output text files folder
-------------------------
The Output text files folder consist of text files which show the accuracies obtained by network, and the training process for the model.
